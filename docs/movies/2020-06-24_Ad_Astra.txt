<b>Ad Astra</b>
<b>James Gray</b><br>
As it is, I am a sucker for science fiction. I don't 
think this is a point of contention. Add in themes of 
existential loneliness and Fermi's paradox?? I'm in. 
Brad Pitt anchors the story, and the screenplay he is 
given really allows him to shine. Watching this so 
close to Father's Day was very cool. I DIG it.
