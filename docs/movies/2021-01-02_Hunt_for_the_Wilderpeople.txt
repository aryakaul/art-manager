<b>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</b>
<b>Taika Waititi</b><br>
The first time I saw this movie was in theaters with 
my dad during a long weekend of my freshman year of 
college. All I remember was liking it immensely, and I 
am proud to say it still holds up. Waititi is probably 
one of my favorite directors working today. All his 
works have this delightful macabre humor punctuated by 
slapstick comedy and well-timed jokes. I've only seen 
fantastic films from him, and I will blindly watch 
whatever he wants to put out next. Also, I wish I 
could visit New Zealand.
