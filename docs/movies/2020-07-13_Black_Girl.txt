<b>Black Girl</b>
<b>Ousmane Semb√®ne</b><br>
It was really short, but did so much in that 
timeframe. I think it touches on the very real problem 
of mythologizing what we perceive as 'enlightened' 
communities; only to have this dream shattered upon 
arriving. I definitely see this play out to a lesser 
extent when my peers talk about Nordic countries as 
some technological utopias. Not saying that these 
countries are bad, but I think this view papers over 
real issues that they face (see: racism). It also 
provides one of the more visceral depictions of the 
systematic exploitation of Africa by European 
countries, a history that I have yet to truly learn. 
Ending got me more than I expected, it's a good film!
