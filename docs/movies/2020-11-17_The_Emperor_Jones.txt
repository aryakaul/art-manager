<b>The Emperor Jones</b>
<b>Dudley Murphy</b><br>
Ooh a really fantastic work. The final monologue in 
particular is acted wonderfully, and Robeson's 
portrayal is incredibly convincing. Murphy does
things with the camera that are just insane. Absolutely
no idea how he pulled it off back then. I walked 
into it with next to no knowledge of what was 
going to happen and I think that's the best way to 
watch it. All the actors do a fantastic job and it
feels like the movie was ahead of its time in so many
ways. Want to now watch the play and look into the lives
of some of these actors.
