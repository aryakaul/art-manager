<b>Election</b>
<b>Alexander Payne</b><br>
This was such a weird film. It honestly feels like 
peak 1999 in the strangest way possible. Lots of 
things about the film work really well: the score 
(that tribal music that plays for Witherspoon is 
GOAT), the freeze frames, and the flashbacks all work 
so well it's amazing. I think my biggest issue was the 
plot. It felt too unwieldy and unfocused. Almost like 
American Beauty, but not in a good way. According to 
Wikipedia, this is also President Obama's favorite 
political film which is... interesting? For that 
reason alone, I'll probably give it another shot at 
some point.
