<b>Infernal Affairs</b>
<b>Andrew Lau, Alan Mak, & Felix Chong</b><br>
Quite good. I thought this would mainly be a 
comparison between Infernal Affairs & The Departed; 
however, after some more thought I'm not sure such a 
head-to-head matchup is possible. Scorsese clearly 
borrows literally everything from this movie (not just 
plot/dialogue, but camera angles and random beats), 
but I'm still not sure the two films are really 
comparable. The Departed is like an extra hour of 
runtime and makes subtle tweaks that updates the film 
to Western tastes, while Infernal Affairs has a more 
textured approach with more emphasis on the 
interactions between the two leads. Both accomplish 
what they set out to do in their own unique way, and I 
think both are excellent films within their own 
sphere. I will say that this film was my first foray 
into Hong Kong cinema so that's pretty fun.
