<b>Bhaji on the Beach</b>
<b>Gurinder Chadha</b><br>
Honestly for whatever reason I forgot that the 
British-Indian identity existed, but I feel like this 
movie captures it in such a realistic way that it's 
been burnt into my mind. Everything about it is so 
cool, the fact that it's primarily set in a beach 
town, the fact that everybody is peak 90s, AND the 
investigation of the intersectional identity of being 
an Indian female immigrant. It's like they made it for 
me. A very fun film.
