Hm. It was fine. I just can't bring myself to really 
care about a period piece on Victorian high-class 
social drama. I'm sure there are interesting takeaways 
on class status and feminism, but I feel like the film 
can't provide meaningful commentary on contemporary 
issues. Anya Taylor Joy was quite good in this.
