<b>Yes, God, Yes</b>
<b>Karen Maine</b><br>
It's a sweet indie film. While watching I realized 
this might be the only female coming-of-age movie I've 
watched? I think that's wrong, but I can't think of 
any other movies like it. It does a good job showing 
the hypocrisy underlying a lot of the religious right. 
The entire film feels really authentic and gave me a 
perspective I had never considered!
