<b>Bowling for Columbine</b>
<b>Michael Moore</b><br>
An evocative examination of America's unique gun 
culture. I wish there was more focus on statistics and 
numbers, but I acknowledge that there is probably more 
emotional oomph in the approach Moore takes. Moore's 
final point that America's gun violence epidemic is 
caused by a culture of fear within our country seems 
logical, but I don't really understand how one goes 
about proving that? Everything is predicated on 
anecdotes and random clips. I was under the impression 
the primary reason is due to the number of guns in our 
country, but apparently Canada also has lots of guns? 
OK, I looked it up and America has 120.5 guns per 100 
people and Canada has 34.7 guns per 100 people. 
Alright, that stat should probably should have been 
included within the documentary. I don't know. Moore 
does a great job of evoking Americana, but something 
more concrete and didactic would have been useful. The 
interview with Marilyn Manson was in-sane. Very cool.
