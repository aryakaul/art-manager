<b>Bad Education</b>
<b>Cory Finley & Mike Makowsky</b><br>
Alison Janey and Hugh Jackman are national treasures. 
They both give such good performances, and just the 
story and the way it's told MWAH. I think there is 
interesting commentary on how our society values 
teachers, but wish there was more of that in this 
movie. Regardless, it's good.
