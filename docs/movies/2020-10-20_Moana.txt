Honestly one of the best Disney 'princess' movies. It 
literally follows Campbell's Hero's Journey to the 
LETTER. Really liked the crab dude, and the homage to 
Fury Road. Animation is beautiful, and I really 
enjoyed seeing Polynesians represented in a film like 
this. I also thought it was very clever to make the 
island hopping the central point of the film, as I do 
think that's one of the most bad ass bits of history 
about that part of the world. gOOd fILm.
