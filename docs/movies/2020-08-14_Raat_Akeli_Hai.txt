<b>Raat Akeli Hai</b>
<b>Honey Trehan</b><br>
It's not great. While it shows a lot of promise in the 
beginning, initiating themes of female empowerment and 
class/caste conflict; it never resolves any of them. I 
enjoy how much it borrows from classic film noir; 
however, it doesn't expand or subvert the genre in 
anyway. In addition, the cast is too large and 
unwieldy for there to be a satisfying ending to the 
case. I'm ANGRY I spent 2hr40m watching this when I 
could have seen two better movies in that timespan >:(
