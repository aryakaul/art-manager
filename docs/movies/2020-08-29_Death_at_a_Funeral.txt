<b>Death at a Funeral</b>
<b>Frank Oz</b><br>
Watched the OG British one with the family. The setup 
is quite clever and delivers in a fun way. Rewatching 
it I realized how much the movie leans on the 
hallucinogenic to deliver comedy, even when maybe it 
isn't warranted. Regardless, I enjoyed it!
