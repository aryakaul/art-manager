<b>Means of Ascent</b>
<b>Robert A. Caro</b><br>
The 2nd volume in Caro's series traces LBJ's 
Senatorial election of 1948 against Coke Stevenson. I 
think the thing that will stick with me is Caro's 
description of Stevenson. The contrast of his 
sincerity with Johnson's ruthlessness strikes me as 
the titular battle between lofty ideals and cold 
pragmatism; one in which I am deeply invested within. 
Valuable lessons should be learnt from the electoral 
loss (theft) of the 1948 election; and I intend to 
think about them in further detail. Unrelated, but 
Stevenson's building of his ranch is b a s e d.
