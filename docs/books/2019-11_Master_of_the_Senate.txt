<b>Master of the Senate</b>
<b>Robert A. Caro</b><br>
GOOD BOOK. Really love Caro. I think he's great. I 
think the thing that stood out to me the most was the 
central battle of the Voting Rights bill. Johnson's 
calculus and strategy is troubling in its 
effectiveness. That being said, I think there are 
valuable lessons to be learned regarding compromise 
and as my boy Theodore would say "practical politics."
