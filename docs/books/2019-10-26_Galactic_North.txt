I thought a collection of sci-fi short stories would 
be a good break from my recent spate of presidential 
non-fiction works. And it was! I certainly appreciate 
the more 'hard' science nature of these stories 
(Reynolds is a former astronomer, v. cool!). Thinking 
about which parts particularly stuck with me; I 
believe Reynolds' description of the collective 
Conjoined was refreshing. This same idea has been 
attempted in so many other works, but Reynolds 
interpretation is satisfying. I also really enjoyed 
the discussion of emergent properties in that short 
story about the worms in the ice world. Excited to 
read his other stuff!
