<b>The Sun Also Rises</b>
<b>Ernest Hemingway</b><br>
Pretty cool stuff. Definitely makes me want to go to 
Spain and enjoy the fiesta. Also want to go fishing in 
a village in Spain. (San Sebastian, Burguete, 
Pampalona). Also really want to drink wine from a 
leather wine skin. In terms of the actual story, I 
enjoyed it. It definitely dragged at times, but I'm 
still trying to understand the take-away message. 
Honestly not sure there is a takeaway message here. 
Focus on Brett/Cohn/Mike/Pedro seems like a metaphor 
but damned if I know. Regardless, pretty cool. Upon 
later reflection, maybe the message is to live 
independently? Everybody unhappy in the book seems to 
have an unhealthy dependence on others (Cohn for 
Brett, Brett for anybody, etc.) I feel like I had the 
most respect for the narrator when he was away from 
everyone else exploring that random place in Spain.
