<b>Revelation Space</b>
<b>Alastair Reynolds</b><br>
This was a good book. Plot felt structured like a 
whirlpool, in the beginning the disparate stories had 
little connection; but as the plot progresses it got 
faster and faster. As before, Reynolds' worldbuilding 
is MWAH. I particularly liked the 'solution' to 
Fermi's paradox, and the latter idea of black holes as 
supercomputers. A very good book, I look forward to 
reading the rest of the series!
