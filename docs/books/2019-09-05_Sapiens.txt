<b>Sapiens</b>
<b>Yuval Noah Harari</b><br>
What a book! Really quite good, eminently readable and 
extremely useful to get a grasp on the scale of modern 
human civilization. Will be rereading soon. Things 
that stuck out: the hidden trap of the agricultural 
revolution, coexistence and extermination of hominins, 
and the idea of money/empire/science.
