<b>Ten Lessons for a Post Pandemic World</b>
<b>Fareed Zakaria</b><br>
A delightful book. As a fan of Zakaria's writing and 
TV show I felt somewhat obligated to give his 
long-form writing a try. Glad to say that it was worth 
it; the medium allows Zakaria to coalesce his 
knowledge across fields and convey the subject matter 
to readers quite easily. I think his lessons are all 
insightful and the book is structured such that each 
lesson feeds into the next which I thought worked 
quite well. Early lessons were sort of obvious to me, 
but from Lesson 7 (Inequality) onwards I learnt quite 
a bit. Thought his depiction of globalization was 
quite clear-eyed and found his writing on the 
potential futures of US-Sino relations comprehensive. 
Favorite parts were the small anecdotes Fareed uses to 
make a point. 'Nothing is written' from Lawrence of 
Arabia & the twin 'Locksley Hall' poems will stick 
with me for a while. Man, I hate 24 hour television 
news.
