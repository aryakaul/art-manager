<b>The Hermit and the Love Thief</b>
<b>Barbara Stoler Miller</b><br>
Collection of poems by Bilhana (Love Thief) and 
Bhartrhari (Hermit). As before, Bharthari is one of my 
favorite poets of all time. Really love his 
perspectives on love and life. Bilhana was 
delightfully descriptive; however, not as insightful. 
Props also has to go to the translator! Miller is an 
undisputed QUEEN of translating Sanskrit works.
