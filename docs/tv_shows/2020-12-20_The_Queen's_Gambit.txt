<b>The Queen's Gambit</b>
<b>Scott Frank</b><br>
Did you know that if you replace the 'r' with an 'n', 
'Arya' would become 'Anya.' So that's gonna be my ice 
breaker when I meet Anya Taylor-Joy. No but it's good, 
especially the set and costume design. I think the 
series is really about addiction and family, but felt 
it left too much for the final episode to really tie 
up. Performances are good all around, but the 
screenplay was a little goofy at times. Probably won't 
come back to it again.
