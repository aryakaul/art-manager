<b>Avatar the Legend of Korra Book 3 Change</b>
<b>Michael Dante DiMartino & Bryan Konietzko</b><br>
Objectively the best villain so far. Takes an even 
more mature tone, with some thoughtful commentary on 
recovering from traumatic episodes. I still think that 
they don't think about the underlying theme of 
individualism vs collectivism enough, but I guess it 
is also a KID'S TV SHOW.
