<b>Better Call Saul Season 3</b>
<b>Vince Gilligan & Peter Gould</b><br>
Quite a fantastic piece of work. There's something so 
deliberate and authentic about their storytelling; the 
entire show has so much to say about America. Also, 
the camera does crazy things throughout the show. The 
way it changes focus is absolutely insane. I'm looking 
forward to getting into Breaking Bad.
