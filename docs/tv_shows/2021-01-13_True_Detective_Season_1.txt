<b>True Detective Season 1</b>
<b>Nic Pizzolatto</b><br>
I think it's really good. Obviously all the leads are 
fantastic, and the script is just beautifully paced 
and written. I will say that the unsung hero of this 
season that just did it for me was the Louisiana 
bayou. Every shot they take of the larger swamp just 
imbues everything with this aura of mystique grandeur. 
It is a thing to behold. I also think the choice to 
focus on the personal lives of the leads was really 
good and helped draw viewers even deeper into this 
world. Quite good.
