<b>Full Bloom</b>
<b>Flowers?</b><br>
Watched this as a family. Idk it's like run of the 
mill competitions. I will say this show introduced me 
to how seriously people take flower arrangements. 
Also, I do NOT like how people spray paint flowers. 
That seems sacrilegious. Also, the way they handled 
picking who to nix was WILD.
