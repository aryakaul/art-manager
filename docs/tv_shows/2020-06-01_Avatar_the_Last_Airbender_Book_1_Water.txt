<b>Avatar the Last Airbender (Book 1: Water)</b>
<b>Michael Dante DiMartino & Bryan Konietzko</b><br>
Very good! I'm rewatching with my sister, and I forgot 
how fantastic the show is. The first book is mainly 
about setting up the world, and developing the main 
cast of characters. It does this effortlessly, and in 
short while, the world is fully realized and filled 
with emotionally complex characters. A true pleasure 
to watch. If that wasn't enough it manages to layer in 
complex themes touching from war to regret. I would 
not think that a freaking Nickelodeon show would be 
able to serve as an effective vehicle for these 
concepts, but it does! VERY GOOD.
