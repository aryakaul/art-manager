<b>Raveena</b>
<b>2019</b><br>
I don't understand how any sane individual cannot 
watch this and fall in love with Raveena. I mean come 
on. Who the hell do you think you are. Everything 
about this is so warm and comforting and soothing. 
There's a moment where Raveena is describing how she 
approaches live shows: "I want to cultivate this 
feeling of softness... and love and vulnerability." 
And I mean how can anyone remain a cynic after hearing 
that. (1) Bloom, (2) Still Dreaming, (3) Honey. Also, 
everyone in the band does such a good job. Good lord.
