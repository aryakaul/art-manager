<h1 align="center"><i> art manager </i></h1>
This is a static website builder to manage one's thoughts and feelings regarding any type of art they choose. 

If you want to use it, you will have to fork it and make it a live website using the Github Pages section in your repo's Settings

If you want to add a genre use `./scripts/add_genre $GENRE_NAME` if you want to add a given piece of art use `./scripts/add_entry $GENRE_NAME`

For example, if I wanted to add the genre Plays I would run `cd scripts; ./add_genre Plays`. If I wanted to document my thoughts on Life of Galileo by Brecht, I would then run `./add_entry Plays` and follow the prompts.

format and structure heavily influenced by the website of [KISS](https://k1ss.org)
