<b>Avatar the Legend of Korra Book 4 Balance</b>
<b>Michael Dante DiMartino & Bryan Konietzko</b><br>
It felt a little too condensed. I don't think they 
were able to really give Kuvira the development she 
deserved. I do like the meta-analysis it provided of 
the entire series and how each antagonist pushed their 
ideology to the extremes. Ending was cool. My sister 
is a big fan of this one.
