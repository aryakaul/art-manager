<b>Fargo Season 4</b>
<b>Noah Hawley</b><br>
As always, Hawley has crafted an intensely unique and 
fantastic TV series experience. The world and all its 
characters are imbued with this overwhelming purpose 
and texture. Chris Rock does a great job. Andrew Bird 
is in this for some wonderful reason. But I think 
Eâ€™myri Crutchfield and Jessie Buckley steal the 
show. Both actresses do such a great job with Hawley's 
characters and script. The season tackles race in an 
interesting way, and the finale neatly ties these 
threads into one singular message. Probably not my 
favorite season of Fargo but miles ahead of the vast 
majority of TV made today.
