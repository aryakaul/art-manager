<b>Succession Season 1</b>
<b>Jesse Armstrong</b><br>
I solely watched it because of the Nerdwriter video on 
it. Wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did, and 
oooooh it's fun. The theme song is unbelievably 
catchy. I don't know, watch the video on it. I don't 
have anything to add. It's not Fargo level, but it's 
still very good.
