<b>Rick and Morty Season 4</b>
<b>Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland</b><br>
Honestly probably the best season yet. The dialogue is 
so dense, yet accessible and self-aware. I don't think 
any show comes close to it, and it's probably up there 
with some of the best TV I've ever seen. I think 
favorite episode goes to the snake one.
