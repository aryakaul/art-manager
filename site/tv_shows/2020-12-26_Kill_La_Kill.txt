<b>Kill La Kill</b>
<b>Hiroyuki Imaishi & Kazuki Nakashima</b><br>
For the first half, it's just a gigantic beautifully 
animated anime meme; but somewhere at the halfway 
point it also becomes a brilliant work of art. 
Storyline is actually inspired, music is amazing, and 
animation is insane. It has no right being as good as 
it is.
