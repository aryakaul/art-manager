Hm. GOOD. While the first season takes its time 
setting up characters and the main narrative thrust, 
it still retained a level of innocence that was sweet. 
This second season does a GOOD job maturing every plot 
line, and beginning to tease at (what I believe to be) 
the main theme to this show: everyone is capable of 
great good and great evil. We see that the previously 
monolithically evil Fire Nation has good people, and 
the 'good guys' are capable of being evil. Allowing 
this level of complexity is so refreshing and 
adorable. My sister is loving it, and with good reason.
