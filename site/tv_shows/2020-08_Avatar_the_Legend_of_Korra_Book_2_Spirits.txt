<b>Avatar the Legend of Korra Book 2 Spirits</b>
<b>Michael Dante DiMartino & Bryan Konietzko</b><br>
Definitely picks up more from the first season. I 
really enjoyed the worldbuilding that this season 
committed to. Villain was not as memorable as others, 
but still serviceable. I think the main theme of Korra 
learning to trust herself to make impactful decisions 
is told very well, and all the side characters have 
fun stories! All in all, a gOOd season.
