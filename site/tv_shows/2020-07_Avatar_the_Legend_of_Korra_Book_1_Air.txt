My sister liked this one significantly more than ATLA, 
which I can see. It definitely is a lot more mature in 
all sorts of ways. I think I appreciate the theme it 
tries to go for of equality; but I think it does a 
really poor job of properly engaging with it. I feel 
like the root cause of the unrest is never really 
addressed. Like what would happen if a random subset 
of the population is given superpowers at birth? 
Wouldn't this lead to profound conflict? Whatever it's 
a cartoon. But still, why even bring these themes up 
if they aren't going to discuss them?
