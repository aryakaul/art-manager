<b>Succession Season 2</b>
<b>Jesse Armstrong</b><br>
Ooo really good ending to this season. I'm perpetually 
amazed how believable the writer's make every possible 
lifeline for the company, only to have it yanked away, 
and then they make you believe in the NEXT lifeline. 
It's crazy, writing is on point. Everybody acts like a 
born thespian, with Brian Cox being untouchable. I 
think there could be more investigation into the toxic 
effect of sensationalist (+ fake) news on democracy, 
but meh. Still good!
