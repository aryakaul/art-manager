<b>Robert A. Caro</b><br>
I devoured this book in one day. I literally can't 
stop wanting to read Caro's prose. It's fucking 
addicting. In terms of lessons to takeaway, I think 
his justification for conducting exhaustive research 
was compelling, I think the way he writes is 
interesting (condensing key ideas, outlining, 
hand-writing, editing, typing), I also want to start 
using his word count idea. I love the way he writes. 
Like really, really love the way he writes.
