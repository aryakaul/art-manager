<b>Autobiography</b>
<b>Theodore Roosevelt</b><br>
V. good book. Highly readable w/ a bunch of lovely 
ideas and thoughts. This book has made TR my favorite 
president (sorry Obama). In particular, I really 
enjoyed Roosevelt's description of the 'Square Deal,' 
the Strenuous (Vigorous) Life, and his thoughts on 
'Practical Politics.' I've also become convinced 
towards his theory of executive power and how it 
should be wielded. Also, LOVED the President's Message 
comic.
