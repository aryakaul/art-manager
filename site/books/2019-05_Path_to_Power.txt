<b>Path to Power</b>
<b>Robert A. Caro</b><br>
I think this is the first biography I've ever read. If 
all biographies are as wonderful, then I have a 
significant amount of catching up to do. This book was 
a fantastic introduction to Lyndon Johnson and follows 
the story of his birth up until his first (failed) run 
for Texas Senator. Caro's writing makes me feel as if 
I am intimately aware of the forces that shaped and 
molded President Johnson. His description and 
historical analysis of the Hill County is 
exceptionally detailed and delightfully told.
