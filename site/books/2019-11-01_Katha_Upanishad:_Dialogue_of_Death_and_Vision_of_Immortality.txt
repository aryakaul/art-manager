<b>Katha Upanishad: Dialogue of Death and Vision of Immortality</b>
<b>Swami Premananda</b><br>
A short work. But an interesting one. I dunno, I 
enjoyed how the evil of the 'sense-perception' was 
described; being able to control those senses and 
calmly interrogate them appears to be the path to 
salvation. I think I agree? It seems reminiscent of 
Bhartrhari's poems and the 'ideal' he strives for. 
Death is regarded as a temporary state change only 
regarded as significant because of our reliance on 
'sense-perception.' Once that idea is better managed, 
one is able to realize the supreme Self is eternal. I 
think I'll read more works translated by Swami 
Premananda in the future. Quite engaging without being 
esoteric.
