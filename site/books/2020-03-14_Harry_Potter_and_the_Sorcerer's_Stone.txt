<b>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</b>
<b>J.K. Rowling</b><br>
Rereading for a book club with the family. I think 
it's a delightful contained children's story. We 
discussed the possibility of reading it through a 
class relations lens. I think it led to some 
interesting analysis. There's a lot of themes about 
being born into certain roles and the potential lack 
of mobility between them. This is all overlaid with 
the larger theme of compassion and love; which creates 
a fun dynamic. I don't know if there's support for 
this theme in the rest of the series; but looking 
forward to rereading the rest!
