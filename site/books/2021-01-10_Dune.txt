<b>Dune</b>
<b>Frank Herbert</b><br>
Innumerable small flourishes transform this book from 
an indulgent sci-fi opera to an English language 
classic. There are too many to go over; however, I do 
want to highlight two of them. The first is the 
character of the desert planet Arrakis. Herbert's 
training as an ecologist comes through clearly, and he 
is able to let readers understand the ecology and 
biome of the Arrakeen landscape beautifully. I think 
there are a lot of lessons to be learned by thinking 
about what Herbert has to say about ecology and 
biological systems. The second is Herbert's use of 
epigraphs. They do a masterful job of fleshing out the 
wider Universe and convey a sense of grandeur rarely 
captured. They create the feeling of 'terrible 
purpose' and contrast beautifully with the story as it 
unfolds. I've revisited this book before, and think I 
will again. It's my type of book.
