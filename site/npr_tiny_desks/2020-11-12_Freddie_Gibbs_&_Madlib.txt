<b>Freddie Gibbs & Madlib</b>
<b>2019</b><br>
Oh my lord this shit slaps. I got into this duo with 
Pinata in high school, and they took their shit to the 
next motherfucking level with Bandana. Watching them 
live is a trip, production is fully fleshed out and 
complements Gibbs perfectly. Entire band goes hard. 
The transition between Education and Gat Damn is primo 
cream-top shit. (1) Education, (2) Soul Right, (3) 
Freestyle Shit, (4) Gat Damn. On a side note, Gibbs is 
one of the few people I follow on Instagram and it's 
awesome.
