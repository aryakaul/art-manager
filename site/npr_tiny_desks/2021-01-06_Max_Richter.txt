<b>Max Richter</b>
<b>2020</b><br>
Listening to 'On the Nature of Daylight' while 
watching the 2021 Joint Congressional Session to 
certify Biden's victory and I finally understand what 
Richter means when he says this song is about the 
melding of politics and fiction. Downside to listening 
to this a bunch is you instantly pick out this song 
when it's playing in movies or commercials (I see you 
Arrival). It's really good, music is raw and you can 
tell Richter thinks deeply about the art of musical 
composition. (1) On the Nature of Daylight, (2) Infra 
5, (3) Vladimir's Blues.
