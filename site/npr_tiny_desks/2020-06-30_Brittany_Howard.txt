<b>Brittany Howard</b>
<b>2019</b><br>
Through watching Brittany Howard perform, it 
immediately becomes clear that she is a master at her 
craft. Her presence is staggering, and complements her 
soulful rhythms beautifully. Her music and lyrics have 
such a quintessential American flavor, their 
experience becomes universal in its appeal. It's a 
good one! (1) Goat Head, (2) Georgia, (3) Baby, (4) 
Stay High. Frankly all the songs are amazing, but 
everything about Goat Head is 10/10 for me. What a 
song.
