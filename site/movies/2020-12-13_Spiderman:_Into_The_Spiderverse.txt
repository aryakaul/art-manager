<b>Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse</b>
<b>Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, & Rodney Rothman</b><br>
Absolutely have no idea how 3 different directors 
could come together to tell a story as lean as this 
one. Every scene is integral and does something 
important, AND does it beautifully. Objectively a 
fantastic animation style. Very good film, wonderfully 
done.
