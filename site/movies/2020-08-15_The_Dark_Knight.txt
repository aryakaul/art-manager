<b>The Dark Knight</b>
<b>Christopher Nolan</b><br>
I think it packages compelling themes of the nature of 
man in an entertaining action flick, which I mean... 
what more can you want? It's a raucous good time, and 
performances are all on point. I have nothing bad to 
say, it's something I'll revisit in the future; 
however, the recent proliferation of the superhero 
genre has dampened my initial enthusiasm for the 
trilogy (through no fault of its own, just DISNEY 
being DISNEY)
