<b>Princess Mononoke</b>
<b>Miyazaki</b><br>
OOoooo this my shit. I really enjoyed the parallels 
between Lady Eboshi and the Wolf Princess. Animation 
is truly lovely. Miyazaki does a masterful job trying 
to show both sides in a fair light, analysing with 
``eyes unclouded by hate``. I still feel like I prefer 
Naussica over this, just because of its more staunch 
environmental stance. Regardless I love it.
