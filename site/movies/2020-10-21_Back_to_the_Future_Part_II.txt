<b>Back to the Future Part II</b>
<b>Robert Zemeckis</b><br>
It's good. It's not great, but it's still good. I 
don't think it does enough to mess with our 
expectations after the first one, and it definitely 
felt like more of a set-up for the third movie. It's a 
little funny to see what they thought 2015 would look 
like. Hm maybe not funny, maybe sad. Wish we could get 
fusion working.
