<b>Knives Out</b>
<b>Rian Johnson</b><br>
Honestly a delightful film. I think it did a masterful 
job subverting expectations, and I think the 
screenplay and overall direction was STUpendous. Like 
a delightful mix of the headiest Wes Anderson with 
peak Sherlock. Every character is very FUN. Sweaters 
being worn are FUN. My only concern is how it will 
hold up to repeat viewings. Once the final destination 
of the rainbow is known, watching gravity bring it to 
that pre-determined point feels... frivolous?
