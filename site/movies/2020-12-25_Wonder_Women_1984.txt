<b>Wonder Women 1984</b>
<b>Patty Jenkins</b><br>
This was the chosen Christmas day family movie, and I 
am irrationally angry at it. Everybody involved in the 
making of this movie should feel ashamed. Unbelievably 
disjointed and incoherent. Literally incapable of 
saying anything worthwhile. The stupid thing is there 
were so many good ideas that the time period could 
allow exploration of, but they just don't. Should have 
watched Die Hard.
