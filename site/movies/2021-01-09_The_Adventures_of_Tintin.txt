<b>The Adventures of Tintin</b>
<b>Steven Spielberg</b><br>
Normally, I'm not a fan of 3D CGI; however, I really 
like the art style of this. I've always loved the 
comics, and I think this movie does a good job paying 
homage to their feel while making something new. It's 
a swashbuckling adventure film that hits all its notes 
with perfection.
