<b>I Am Greta</b>
<b>Nathan Grossman</b><br>
As always, any discussion of climate change is apt to 
bring about the triplet emotions of anger, despair, 
and hope. This documentary is no exception; however, I 
do think it falls pretty heavily on the pessimistic 
side of things. Greta makes very clear she isn't 
comfortable with her mythologization, and I think the 
film does a good job of emphasizing that her only goal 
is to decrease emissions. It was tough to see her 
constantly used as a prop by the largely ineffective 
idiots calling the shots. If our history is ever read 
by intelligent life, I hope the names of those who 
killed the world are included.
