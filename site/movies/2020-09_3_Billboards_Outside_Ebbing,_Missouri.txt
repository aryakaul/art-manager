<b>3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</b>
<b>Martin McDonagh</b><br>
This was a really good movie. It really digs itself 
deep into the psyche. I think the ending was a little 
abrupt, and in general the story felt meandering at 
times. That said, all of the characters are so richly 
realized that it is possible to empathize with any of 
them. Actors are great all around, really interesting 
movie.
