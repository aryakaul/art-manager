<b>Bend it like Beckham</b>
<b>Gurinder Chadha</b><br>
Hm. It's good. I do think I preferred Bhaji on the 
Beach just because it felt more risky. There were 
times where the film becomes very generic and boring. 
I really like how it incorporated the lived racism of 
the family into an explanation of their conservatism 
and patriarchal attitudes. I certainly hadn't ever 
considered that before. Definitely a big fan of Chadha.
