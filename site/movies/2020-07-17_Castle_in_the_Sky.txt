<b>Castle in the Sky</b>

Hmmm. Definitely one of the most 'Ghibli' films I've 
seen of Studio Ghibli so far. It's such a fun little 
adventure. I do think it doesn't tell as deep a story 
as some others; however, I do think it still captures 
childlike innocence and love in a very rewarding 
manner. I think it is quite good.
