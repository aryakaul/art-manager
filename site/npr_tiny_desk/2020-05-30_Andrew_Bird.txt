Winner of the HOLY SHIT award. Definitely in the 
contender for GOAT. The only acceptable ranking of 
these songs is (1) Roma Fade (2) Are you serious, and 
(3) Capsized. Bird's use of plucking his violin and 
whistling the tune is amazing. It's so CRISP. I have 
no idea how Bob Boilen captures this level of audio 
fidelity but good lord it's beautiful. Performance and 
energy of the whole ensemble is on point. Always 
leaves me with a big ole' grin. Roma Fade is top tier.
